      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>The convex hull of a set Q of points is the smallest convex polygon P for which each point in Q is either on the boundary of P or in its interior. In this project, I developed a program to compute the convex hull of given points using a divide and conquer algorithm as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Divide the set of points into two subsets, L and R.</li>
        <li>Computing the convex hulls of L and R recursively where the base case is two points.</li>
        <li>Combining the convex hulls of L and R by finding the upper and lower common tangents and making those tangents part of the new combined convex hull.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There were many cases which I had to account for when finding the common tangents, i.e. when the top point of L was lower than the top point of R and vice versa. In addition to this I had to make sure that the search for common tangents stopped at the correct points.</p>
