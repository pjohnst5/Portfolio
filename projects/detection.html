      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>The goal of this project was to detect birds in images. I worked on it with two other students over the course of a week. The approached we used was as follows: </p>
      <p>First we extracted SIFT features from images of birds and non-birds alike, and trained a k-means clustering model to produce K, 128-dimensional cluster centers where K was the number of visual words (in our case we chose 256 visual words).</p>
      <p>Next, for each training image, we extracted SIFT features and converted these SIFT features into a histogram representation. Each bin of the histogram represeted one of the K cluster centers we made with the K-means model, and the frequency of each bin was how many SIFT features from the training image were closest to that cluster.</p>
      <p>We then labeled the training data accordingly, histogram representation of images of birds having a label of "1" and everything else having a label of "-1". We then trained a Support Vector Machine on this data.</p>
      <p>Finally, we created an algorithm to do sliding window detection on test images by making bounding boxes move across a test image and using Non-Maximal Suppression to make sure we didn't keep two bounding boxes of the same bird. Basically, when the sliding window came across a part of the image that the SVM predicted was a bird, we printed out that window.</p>
