    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>The Immigrant Ancestor Project is funded by the Center for Family History and Genealogy. It is a database driven website used by multiple teams of student researchers to record, search, and download information about immigrant ancestors.</p>
     <p>In a team of 3 developers, I maintained current functionality of the website while also implementing new functionality such as re-ordering images, rows, and fields, updating database information for deleting records, and adding checkbox fields. We communicated directly with the professor in charge of the project along with her cohorts and would meet with them in person on a semi-monthly basis.</p>
     <p>I also was responsible for converting the MySQL database from the older version of the website into a SQL database with a new schema and overall structure. This involved writing a program to select records from the MySQL database, convert the JSON formatted columns to appropriate formats for the SQL database, and inserting this info into the SQL database. With close to 1 million records, this required much attention to detail and optimization. I was able to reduce the run time of the program by 24 hrs.</p>
