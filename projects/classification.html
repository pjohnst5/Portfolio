      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This project consisted of using deep neural networks available through the PyTorch's library to classify the Stanford Cars Dataset. The networks I tested were ResNet18, AlexNet and VGG. I modified each networks by changing the last fully connected layer to match the number of output classes possible for the cars dataset. I also augmented the training data in two ways: Reflecting each training image on it's y axis and randomly cropping 3/4 of each training image four times. I experimented with different batch sizes, learning rates, momentum terms and number of workers.</p>
      <p>The highest accuracy was 77% attained through the ResNet18 using the Randomly Cropped Dataset.</p>
