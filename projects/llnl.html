      <h2>About: In detail</h2>
      <p>During my internship at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab I designed and developed a full-stack visual analysis web application using a Django Python backend and JavaScript frontend. This app was brand new and solely my project with the help of full-time devs. At the beginning of my internship I met with full-time hydrogeologists (the customers) to gather requirements for the application and understand the context of the problem at hand. At the end of every two-week sprint, I would meet with these same hydrogeologists to present working prototypes and receive feedback. I worked one-on-one with full-time developers and used the Atlassian suite to track my progress on the app through JIRA cards, pull requests and code reviews.</p>
      <p>Granted I can't go into much detail about the app's purpose due to security reasons but I can say that MRSTAT Map (Mass Removal STatistical Analysis Tool Map) uses Treemaps to visualize groundwater decontamination data in a way that's both simple and visually appealing. The size of colored tiles indicates how much water had been pumped from the areas of the lab and the intensity of color of the tiles indicates how many kgs of waste had been removed from this water. By using visual cues (size and color) hydrogeologists can easily identify which areas of the lab are being cleaned most effectively and where they should focus future cleaning efforts.</p>
